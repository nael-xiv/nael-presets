## Changelog
### 01/06/2025
### Nael Presets 2025 June Update

Changes to naelgpose, adjustments to bloom settings for better compatibility.

VanillaEnhance is now VanillaEnhance T1, for consistency in naming conventions for the new VanillaEnhance T2.


Added: 

VanillaEnhance T2 (iMMERSE Pro recommended)

The newest addition to the family includes my personal daily driver, based on VanillaEnhance T1. This version includes a subtle MagicHDR bloom, and iMMERSE Pro Clarity. This version is more performance-demanding than the other presets, but serves as my latest version in enhancing the game's vanilla colours.

This presets requires a paid iMMERSE Pro shader to function fully, but it is completely optional.

## Preset Information

### naelgameplay T1

The original preset I created, this makes use of a LUT file in order to correct the green tinting of the game, as well as adding some contrast by lowering shadows slightly and some texture sharpening. This version uses CMAA as additional anti-aliasing.


### naelgameplay T2

I created this version with lesser LUT correction strength, to let some of the game's original colour through. This version uses Directionally Localized Anti Aliasing as additional anti-aliasing.


### VanillaEnhance T1

This version makes use of colour temperature correction to correct the green tinting of the game. This method is far superior to preserving the game's colours while fixing its glaring issues.


### VanillaEnhance T2

My current daily driver, this version includes a tweaked MagicHDR bloom and makes use of iMMERSE Pro Clarity for texture sharpening. Due to these effects, it is noticeably more intensive to run compared to others in the series.


### naelgpose

Utilizing the correction techniques of both naelgameplay and VanillaEnhance, this intensive preset is best used for the game's GROUP POSE function. The resulting raw image allows users editing flexibility, and is showcased on my posts on my Twitter. This should be compatible in most of the game's areas.
