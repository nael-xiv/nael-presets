The original preset I created, this makes use of a LUT file in order to correct the green tinting of the game, as well as adding some contrast by lowering shadows slightly and some texture sharpening. This version uses CMAA as additional anti-aliasing.

I created this version with lesser LUT correction strength, to let some of the game's original colour through. 

## VanillaEnhance T1

This version makes use of colour temperature correction to correct the green tinting of the game. This method is far closer to preserving the game's colours while fixing its glaring issues.


## VanillaEnhance T2

My current daily driver, this version includes a tweaked MagicHDR bloom and makes use of iMMERSE Pro Clarity for texture sharpening. Due to these effects, it is noticeably more intensive to run compared to others in the series.


## naelgpose

Utilizing the correction techniques of both naelgameplay and VanillaEnhance, this intensive preset is best used for the game's GROUP POSE function. The resulting raw image allows users editing flexibility, and is showcased on my posts on my Twitter. This should be compatible in most of the game's areas.
